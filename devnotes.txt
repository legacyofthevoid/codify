/**NOTES**/
	1. Developers should always encapsulate incoming requests
	2. Eager-loading is a must
	3. in creating database tables DO NOT FORGET to add a column "slug" - if there's a column title, name or anything that 
		distingues ownership of a context
	4. in creating database tables DO NOT FORGET to add $table->timestamps()  - we may need it in the future

	TODO:
	1.	 fix the API class to have a better and more fluid class system. The class system right now is to static for a developer (~printf)
	2.	further research soft-delete ~printf
